Stage 1 - Basic Chatbot

In this stage, we build a basic chatbot using Streamlit and the OpenAI API. The chatbot provides a simple user interface where users can interact and receive AI-generated responses.
At this stage, the chatbot runs entirely on the frontend, meaning Streamlit directly communicates with the OpenAI API. This setup serves as the foundation for later stages, where we will introduce a backend and enhance functionality.
